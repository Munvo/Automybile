Munvo take home assessment

## Instructions
The candidate will develop a simple CRUD application that allows users to reserve cars with a simple UI.

In the application there should be three tables:
- Users
- Cars
- Reservations

User table should contain minimum of three columns:
- User ID
- First Name
- Last Name

Car table should contain minimum of two columns:
- Car ID
- Car model

Reservation should contain minimum of two columns:
- Reservation ID
- Date

The candidate will have to figure out how these tables are related, and add the necessary columns to the tables to represent that relation. The candidate is allowed to add more columns if they feel it is necessary.

The candidate has to write the application in Java for server side, and for the UI they can use HTML, CSS, and Javascript. They can use any Database type they want and they can use any web service.

This is what we expected to see in the application:
 - Proper Rest API usage
 - Java Design Patterns
 - Library Dependency management
 - Create, Delete, Update a User
 - Create, Delete, Update a Car
 - Create, Delete, Update a Reservation
 - List of all users who have reserved a car.
