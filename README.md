# Automybile
Munvo take home assessment

## Instructions
The candidate will develop a simple CRUD application that allows users to reserve cars with a simple UI.

In the application there should be three key objects
- Users
- Cars
- Reservations

For users we expect to track their name, and another basic details you think are necessary, keep it simple.

For cars we want to track all the make and model of cars "Automyble" owns. 

We would like our users(customers) to be able to reserve a car for a date and time for their use. Any additional information you think is necessary please add.

The candidate will have to figure out how these tables are related, and add the necessary columns to the tables to represent that relation. The candidate is allowed to add more columns if they feel it is necessary.

The candidate has to write the application in Java for server side, and for the UI they can use HTML, CSS, and Javascript. They can use any Database type they want and they can use any web service.

This is what we expected to see in the application:
 - Proper Rest API usage
 - Java Design Patterns
 - Library Dependency management
 - Create, Delete, Update a User
 - Create, Delete, Update a Car
 - Create, Delete, Update a Reservation
 - List of all users who have reserved a car.
